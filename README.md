# FMCG Profitability & Risk Analytics 

This project analyzes FMCG category-wise profitability and risk exposure using **SQL** and **Power BI**.

---

## Business Objective

- Identify high-risk categories with low profit margins  
- Track revenue contribution across regions  
- Provide action-based recommendations for management decision-making  

---

## Tools Used

- **SQL** (Data Preparation & Querying)  
- **Power BI** (Dashboard Design & KPI Tracking)  
- **DAX** (Profitability Measures & Risk Segmentation)

## Key Insights (To be added)

- Based on the Power BI dashboard and SQL analysis, the following insights were identified:

- *Dairy and Beverage categories contribute the highest revenue*, making them core focus segments.
- Certain categories such as *Snacks show low or negative profit margins*, indicating urgent pricing or cost review.
- *High-risk product segments are concentrated in low-margin categories*, requiring immediate management attention.
- Commodity-driven inflation significantly increases cost pressure across FMCG supply chains.
- Regional contribution varies, showing imbalance in revenue distribution and profitability stability.

---

## Strategic Recommendations (To be added)

- To improve profitability and reduce inflation-driven risk, FMCG leadership should consider:

1. *Review pricing strategy for low-margin categories*
   - Especially Snacks and Instant Food products.

2. *Optimize raw material sourcing*
   - Focus on commodities with high inflation impact such as milk, cocoa, and edible oils.

3. *Strengthen cost control in packaging and logistics*
   - These cost components contribute heavily to margin decline.

4. *Prioritize stable and high-margin categories*
   - Invest more in categories marked as “Stable”.

5. *Use dashboards for monthly executive monitoring*
   - Track inflation impact, margin health, and risk concentration regularly.
